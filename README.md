# Overview
This project aims to provide a beginner-friendly REPL for Common Lisp with rich functionalities, such as IPython for Python.

What this project tries to achieve are listed here.

- [x] powerful multiline editing with gnu readline.
- [x] saving and loading multiline history.
- [x] tab-completion of symbols.
- [x] simple installation instruction.
- [x] code editting with text editor.
- [ ] useful debugger & inspector. (incomplete)
- [x] syntax highlighting of input texts.
- [x] paren-matching.
- [ ] implementation independence: builds on SBCL and CCL. Segfaults on ECL.
- [ ] autoindentation

# Installation

## Method 1: Download the binary

Look up the latest release compatible with your OS under https://github.com/lisp-maintainers/cl-repl/releases.

If your choice of OS is not listed, you can help make lisping easier for others by contributing a PR. Take a look at the [.github/workflows/CI.yml](.github/workflows/CI.yml) for an inspiration. If it's unix-based, it might be as simple as adding a name to matrix -> OS.

## Method 2: Rosswell

CL-REPL can be installed via roswell as follows.

```
$ ros install lisp-maintainers/cl-repl
```

Before installation, please ensure that gnu readline is installed.
If you use OSX, you might need to execute following command.

```
$ brew link --force readline
```

Also, ensure that your terminal support 256 colors.

### Note about installation via Roswell

If you installed roswell with normal configurations, cl-repl will be located in `~/.roswell/bin`. Â 
To use cl-repl from the command line, please ensure the PATH variable includes `~/.roswell/bin`.

# Usage

```
$ cl-repl
```

or

```
$ ros repl
```

Some useful magic commands are ready to use. To list available commands:

```
CL-USER> %help
```

## Configuration
You can customize CL-REPL by editting `~/.replrc`. You can change appearance, add your own commands, and do anything you want when startup.
An example can be found [here](./replrc-example).

## Syntax highlighting
Syntax highlighiting of input area is new in v0.5.0.
If you want to disable it, put the following in your `.replrc`.

```
(disable-syntax)
```

## execute shell
If the line starts with `!`, excute it as shell command, e.g. `!ls -a`.

## %edit magic
Line editting in repl is sometimes painful. CL-REPL allows yot to edit code with your favorite text editor.

```
CL-REPL> %edit <filename>
```

CL-REPL invokes a text editor specified by `$EDITOR`.
After editting code, save and close it. Then repl will start to evaluate it.
If `<filename>` is not supplied, a temporary file will be created and deleted after evaluation.

We've be sure the following editors work properly.

- vi & vim
- GNU Emacs
- joe's own editor
- Lem

### List of Tasks

- [ ] (Complexity: high) Support for menu based completion: can we have an ipython-like dropdown menu based completion?
- [x] (Complexity: moderate) MacOS Binaries through Github Actions
- [ ] (Complexity: moderate) Linux Arm64 binaries through Travis or something else
- [ ] (Complexity: moderate) Windows Binaries
- [ ] (Complexity: moderate) Automating tests
- [ ] (Complexity: moderate) Add support for logs
